        <p>Hi I'm Frontend developer at <span className="about__highlight">Ramco Systems</span>, having 2.7+ years experience in building a frontend application platform for LBC Express along with awesome people. I was graduated from <span className="about__highlight">Ramco Institute of Technology, B.E(C.S.E) - 2014 to 2018, Rajapalayam. </span></p>
        <p>As a software engineer, I enjoy building things using latest web technologies 
          around me. I have experience in developing and designing web application, with
           efficient and modern backends. I have been coding for almost 2.7+ years now 
           and I have a strong interest in developing the web apps and solving conceptual 
           and analytical problems. I am an enthusiastic learner, and believe that 
           learning grows by sharing. I love exploring and experimenting new technologies. </p>
        <p>I also write articles on medium about the technologies and the toughest problems 
          which I have solved during the development</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding or pushing pixels, I'm probably reading, travelling or crossing off another item on my wish list.</p>
